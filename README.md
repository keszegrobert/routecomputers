# routecomputers
A bunch of algorithms computing routes in the given graph

Dijkstra - computes routes using a priority queue for deciding which node to choose in the next step (one to many points)

QuickDijkstra - computes routes using a simple queue for deciding which node to choose in the next step (one to many points)

FibonacciDijkstra - computes routes using a fibonacci heap for deciding which node to choose in the next step (one to many points)

BellmanFord - this algorithm can handle edges with negative weights to compute routes (one to many points)

FloydWarshall - this algorithm can compute routes from every point to every point.
